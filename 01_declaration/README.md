# Variables declaration
## Variables
* You must use all the declared variables
* `var` can declare global variables
* `:=` can't declare global variables (short declaration)

**Note**: Use short declaration operator as much as possible
 
**Note**: Use var for zero value and package scope
## Operators 
`x := 10`: Declares x and assign the value 10 (short declaration operator)

`x = 20`: Only assign 20 to the already declared x variable, you can't assign before declare it
